# RAP CAVIAR GENDER TRACKER

The Rap Caviar Gender Tracker tracks the gender balance for Spotify's [Rap Caviar](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX0XUsuxWHRQd) playlist.

The purpose of this project is to call attention to the way that the increase in the number, impact and influence of female rappers in the last decade is not reflected on Rap Caviar. This should not be seen as any shade towards Rap Caviar per s√©, as the gender imbalance is present across other playlists and charts throughout the industry. And while the construction of all these charts is pretty opaque, it could just be accurately reflecting exactly how far the rap game is from gender parity.

Genders are automatically inferred from LastFM and Wikipedia bios. If an artist bio is missing or incomplete, the gender might encode incorrectly. (Groups are also an issue and currently need to be encoded manually.)
